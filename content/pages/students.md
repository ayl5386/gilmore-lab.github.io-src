The Brain Development Lab, part of the [Psychology Department](http://psych.la.psu.edu) at Penn State, is looking for research assistants to study brain development in infants, children, and adolescents for **Fall 2015**. You can earn research project (PSY 494) credit or work study funds, and learn video, computer, and communication skills. Prior research experience and computer skills are a plus, but aren't required. We are especially interested in students who have morning availability, computer skills, or are interested in developing skills in advertising, marketing, or public relations. You may apply by completing an [application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1HgafpfTVPyMk_Wzf4b_ubzig_fs4lFGS6qh_y0sa0uE/viewform).

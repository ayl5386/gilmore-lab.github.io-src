# Rick Gilmore's Lab @ Penn State

## Mission

The Gilmore Lab in the [Psychology Department](http://psych.la.psu.edu) at [Penn State](http://www.psu.edu) studies the development of perception, action, and memory. Our goal is to understand patterns of brain and behavioral change in infants, children, and young adults. We use behavioral, EEG, and MRI methods in our research. 

## Active Projects

We have several active projects related to visual perception and open science that are described [here]({filename}/pages/research.md). You can also get a taste of what we do by visiting the <a href="https://databrary.org">Databrary</a> digital data library, specifically the page devoted to <a href="https://databrary.org/party/6">our research</a>.

Title: participants

# Research Participant Information
The Brain Development Laboratory is interested in how the visual system develops over time. To reach this goal, we use EEG to study how the infant, child and adult brain responds to rotational, translational and radial motion. We are also interested in how the brain responds to different types of patterns.

## MRI Studies
fMRI provides information about blood flow in the brain.

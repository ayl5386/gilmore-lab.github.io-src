I've been threatening to move my lab's website to [GitHub](http://github.com). We now have a working site [here]({filename}/pages/home.md) using Pelican. This should make it easier to maintain and to share updating duties among different team members. I'm also hopeful that it will give some of the students a chance to learn about version control and open science practices. YOLO, or should I say YMMV? In any event, OMG, we're doing it. LOL?

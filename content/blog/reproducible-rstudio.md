I've adopted [RStudio's](http://www.rstudio.com) RMarkdown format to create reproducible workflows, reports, and talks. Class lectures are also a breeze now that I've figured out how to easily embed videos using the HTML5 `<video>` tag.

<div class="centered">
<video controls height=500px>
  <source src="https://databrary.org/slot/6493/-/asset/11635/download?inline=true" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
</div>

This is a video from [Databrary](https://nyu.databrary.org/volume/75?key=slot) showing one of the optic flow displays we used in the Gilmore, Thomas, and Fesi (submitted) paper whose analysis and figures are reported [here](https://github.com/gilmore-lab/gilmore-thomas-fesi-2015).

For the time being, I'm producing all of my talks and analyses using this workflow. Of course, we're using GitHub for version control. A course on these ideas based on [Gandrud's book](https://www.crcpress.com/Reproducible-Research-with-R-and-R-Studio/Gandrud/9781466572843) is on my radar.
